# Discord-Token-Booster
Discord Token server booster made with puppeteer, Does not have to solve hcaptcha on login.

Requirements:
`Brave Browser`
`tokens with nitro on them`

Installation:
`latest version of node.js (google to download latest version of it)`

`npm install puppeteer-extra`

`npm install puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`

`npm install cli-color`

`npm install gradient-string`

`npm install console-title`

`npm install fs`

More information:
After you enter server invite and token it will login, You will have to solve the hcaptcha manually the first time the token needs to join the server invite, after that you will not have to solve the captcha.
Proxy: You can simply look up how to add proxies to puppeteer program nodejs and you can add yourself. Are they required? no you do not need to run proxies with this program but using a vpn doesn't effect the token so I would use a vpn.
